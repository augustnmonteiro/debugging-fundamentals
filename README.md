# Welcome to Debugging Fundamentals

This is the official repository of the "Debugging Fundamentals" course. Here you will find challenges to practice, as well as all the examples used during the classes, still with the errors so you can resolve them. The main project used in the course is also available without the bugs presented during the classes.

Below are all the instructions to execute the codes on your machines and practice what was learned in our classes.

# Challenges

This repository contains debugging challenges to practice everything that was taught. Each challenge is implemented in a separate JavaScript file and can be executed in a web browser. Below are the instructions to execute these challenges.

## How to run the challenges

Follow these steps to run the challenges on your local machine:

1. **Open the terminal and clone the repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/seu-usuario/desafios-js-puro.git
```

2. **Navigate to the challenges directory in the repository:**

```
cd challanges
```

3. **Run the challenges:**

- **Option 1: Live Server (recommended):**

  We recommend using Live Server to run the HTML files locally. If you have the Live Server extension installed, simply start using the extension in VSCode. This will automatically open your default browser with the HTML page of the challenge, updating it automatically whenever there are changes to the files.

- **Option 2: Open in the browser:**

  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You will see a web page with a simple interface.

## Running the challenges

For each specific challenge, follow these steps:

### 1. Debugging with Logs

- **Navigate to the challenge directory:**

    ```
    cd debugging-with-logs
    ```

- **Run the challenge with Live Server on the** `index.html` **file**

- **Fix the code bugs**

### 2. Debugging with VSCode

- **Navigate to the challenge directory:**

    ```
    cd debugging-with-vscode
    ```

- **Install project dependencies:**
    ```
    npm install

    ```
    cd reading-error-messages
    ```
    
    Inside this folder, there are various challenges of different errors, just enter the challenge folder you want to perform and:

- **Run the challenge with Live Server on the** `index.html` **file**

- **Fix the code bugs**

### 4. Troubleshooting

Before anything else, it is necessary to initialize the execution of the backend and frontend, below are the instructions.

#### BACKEND

    ```
    npm start
    ```

#### FRONTEND

- **Navigate to the frontend directory of the challenge:**

    ```
    cd troubleshooting/frontend
    ```

- **Run the challenge frontend with Live Server on the** `index.html` **file**

- **Fix the code bugs**

# HANDS ON

These are the examples used during our classes, all examples are with errors. Below I will leave the steps on how to execute each example so you can fix them.

Navigate to the directory `HANDS ON`

```
cd hands-on
```

### 1. CHROME DEVTOOLS

- **Navigate to the challenge directory:**
   ```
   cd hands-on/chrome-devtools
   ```

- **Fix the code bugs**

### 3. VSCODE

- **Navigate to the challenge directory:**
   ```
   cd hands-on/vscode
   ```
- **Install project dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```
- **Run the backend of the challenge:**
   ```
   npm start
   ```
- **Fix the code bugs**

### 4. TROUBLESHOOTING

Before anything else, it is necessary to initialize the execution of the backend and frontend, below are the instructions.

#### BACKEND

   ```
   npm start
   ```

#### FRONTEND

- **Navigate to the frontend directory of the challenge:**
   ```
   cd hands-on/troubleshooting/frontend
   ```
- **Run the challenge frontend with Live Server on the** `index.html` **file**

- **Fix the code bugs**

# MAIN PROJECT - MATH GAME
